<h2> &nbsp;  VISCERAL BLOOM</h2>
<h4> &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello! My name is Kendra, or KP!</h4>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; To be honest, I have no idea what I'm doing! I have a desire to learn basic html and CSS though. I'm an artist that works mostly with traditional media, sometimes digitalâ€“ so after taking a super basic introductory computer programming course, and after stumbling across Obsidian and the concept of Digital Gardens, I've had the idea of maybe being able to build a static site of some kind! I know there are hosters and builders for that, but I just wanted to toy around with it and see how it all works. </p>  
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm not too sure what else to say for now- so I guess that's it! If you know of any decent ways to practice + learn CSS, feel free to get ahold of me! Obviously just doing it is the way to go, but I really like finding other sites and tools that make it either easier or fun, cause why not lol.</p><br><br><br>
